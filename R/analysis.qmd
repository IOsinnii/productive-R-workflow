## Introduction

This R script is a result of an assignment and makes a simple analysis of variables `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` from popular [palmerpenguin dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) in R in several steps.

All source data, functions and outputs are contained within the R project and can be reproduced

## Load libraries

For this data analysis we will need next **R packages**: *tidyverse*, *hrbrthemes* and *patchwork*

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse) 
library(hrbrthemes)    # ipsum theme for ggplot2 charts
library(patchwork)
```

## Load data

Letâ€™s load a clean data version, together with **functions** available in `functions.R`.

```{r}
# Source functions
source(file="functions.R")
# Read the clean dataset
data <-  readRDS("./../input/clean_data.rds")
```

## Descriptive statistics

### Summary

Let's use one of generic functions to see basic statistics on all data columns

```{r}
summary(data)
```

### Calculating specific metric

**Mean bill length** for Adelie specie on different islands using dplyr

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
    summarize(mean_bill_length = num(mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), digits= 2))
```

## Visualizations using ggplot2

### Scatter plot showing bill length and bill depth correlation

Plot **mean bill length** vs. **mean bill depth** for different species, 3 species combined on one graph.

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship between bill <b>length</b> and bill <b>depth</b>. <b>All</b> data points included. It may seem that alltogether data resembles negative correlation between bill length and bill depth"}
data %>% 
na.omit() %>%  
ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species, shape = species)) +     geom_point() +     
labs(x = 'Bill Length (mm)', y = 'Bill Depth (mm)', title = 'Penguin Bill Dimensions') +     scale_shape_manual(values = c("Adelie" = 16, "Chinstrap" = 17, "Gentoo" = 18))
```

### Splitting initial scatterplot

Let's use *patchwork* and our previously created and loaded `scatterplot.f` function to make 3 side-by-side scatterplots for separate species.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height= 3, fig.width= 9, fig.cap="There is actually a positive correlation when split by species."}

p1 <- scatterplot.f(data, "Adelie","red")
p2 <- scatterplot.f(data, "Chinstrap","green")
p3 <- scatterplot.f(data, "Gentoo","blue")
p1 + p2 + p3
```

### Showing tabular data side-by-side

It is also interesting to note that `bill length` and `bill depth` are quite different from one specie to another. This is summarized in the 2 tables below:

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
data %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

data %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(avg_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```
