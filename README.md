# R-quarto-tutorial

This is my first published web page with Github pages containing a tutorial output for Quarto mark down exploratory data analysis.
The tutorial was provided and modified by me in Productive R workflow course by Yan Holtz, focusing on mastering R code cleaning, 
version control, Quarto formatting and web deployment.
